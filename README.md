# Euterpe
Mighty Euterpe, muse of music, write me a song real good.

I have lots of plans for things to add but right now this is what she does:

**INPUT**:

- Give her the number of chords you want in your progression (integer value)
- (Optional) Give her the key you want, otherwise she just gives the numeral version (String value ex. "C" (probably easy to break))
- (Optional (and broken)) Starting chord if you have something specific in mind but this is hella broken.

**OUTPUT**:

- Single randomized "valid" chord progression in numerals and optional chords.


**FUTURE EXPANSIONS**:

Eventually shes getting a UI so that the input options are harder to fuck up.
I also want to give her the ability to produce all "valid" chord progressions for the given constraints instead of just one random one, 
but I didn't feel like trying that hard yesterday.

I also want to add the ability to enter a progression and check if it's "valid" (because this was the original tool I wanted).

-----------------------------------------
I made this because I realized harmonic progression is a state machine and thought it would be fun.
